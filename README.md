# Compiler-Offline
Compiler offline of my 3-1. You'll need linux or windows subsystem of linux to run these files. 
The first file is a cpp file which contains the code for symbol table buildup and necessary operations on it. 
The second file is the lex file, which contains regular expressions of c language tokens. It is a lexical analyzer and can detect c key words and then send them to the bison file for processing.
The third file is the yacc file, which may be also called bison file (yacc bison). It detects tokens sent from lexical analyzer and matches grammar of c language. 
That's all after completing compiler offline 3-1.
